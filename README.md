# Tweet-Emotion-Recognizer

In this project I created a recurrent neural network and train it on a tweet emotion dataset to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions. This is a multi class classification problem in the natural language processing domain. I used TensorFlow as my machine learning framework.

In this project I focused on the following objectives:
1. Using a Tokenizer in TensorFlow
2. Padding and Truncating Sequences
3. Creating and Training Recurrent Neural Networks
4. Using NLP and Deep Learning to perform Text Classification
